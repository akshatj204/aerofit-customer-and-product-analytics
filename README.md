# Aerofit Customer Profiling & Product Analytics

This project analyzes AeroFitâ€™s treadmill sales data to uncover customer demographics, fitness preferences, and purchase behavior.  
The aim is to provide actionable insights and recommendations that help AeroFit recommend the right treadmill models (KP281, KP481, KP781) to new customers and optimize product positioning strategies.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Cleaning & Exploration**  
  - Explored data types, handled missing values, outliers, and distributions.  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Univariate and bivariate visualizations (count plots, histograms, box plots, heatmaps).  
  - Customer behavior studied across **age, gender, income, fitness level, and product purchased**.  

- **Statistical Analysis**  
  - Built two-way contingency tables.  
  - Computed marginal and conditional probabilities (e.g., likelihood of a male customer purchasing KP781).  

- **Customer Segmentation & Insights**  
  - Identified key customer groups for each treadmill model.  
  - Mapped relationships between **fitness goals, income brackets, and usage frequency**.  

- **Business Recommendations**  
  - Strategies to target the right customer segments.  
  - Improved positioning of treadmill models based on user needs.
